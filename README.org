Here is a brief description of a few quick steps to get the Lispbot up
and running.

Firstly you have to install and/or load the bot. See INSTALL, for
details.

Then you have to create a bot instance. This is done by:

     (make-bot "nick" "#mychannel" :plugins '(plugin1 plugin2...))

The second argument can also be a list of channels. The bot will join
them all.

The plugins can either be the classname of a plugin (e.g.
'bot-plugins:help-plugin), an instance of a plugin or a list of any of
those.

For example:

     (bot:make-bot "lispbot" '("#chan1" "#chan2")
                   :plugins (list 'bot.plugins:help-plugin
                                  'bot.plugins:dice-plugin
                                  (make-instance 'bot.plugins:greet-plugin
                                                 :greet-new-users t))

To let the bot connect to a server and start, type:

     (bot:start bot "example.com")

You can stop the bot by interrupting the read-loop (typically `C-c').
It will automatically disconnect from the server.
