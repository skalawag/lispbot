Here is a brief description of a few quick steps to get the Lispbot up
and running.

Firstly you have to install and/or load the bot. See INSTALL, for
details.

Then you have to create a bot instance. This is done by:

     (make-bot "nick" "#mychannel" plugin1 plugin2...)

The second argument can also be a list of channels. The bot will join
them all.

The plugins can either be the classname of a plugin (e.g.
'bot-plugins:help-plugin), an instance of a plugin or a list of any of
those.

For example:

     (bot:make-bot "lispbot" '("#chan1" "#chan2")
                   'bot.plugins:help-plugin
                   'bot.plugins:dice-plugin
                   (make-instance 'bot.plugins:greet-plugin
                                  :greet-new-users t))

To let the bot connect to a server and start, type:

     (bot:connect bot "example.com")
     (bot:read-loop bot)

You can stop the bot by interrupting the read-loop (typically `C-c')
and type:

     (bot:disconnect bot)
